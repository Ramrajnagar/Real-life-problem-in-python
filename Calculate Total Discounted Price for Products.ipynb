    "A company offers discounts based on a tiered system, where each productâ€™s discount is determined by a percentage based on its price. Write a Python program that calculates the total discounted price of a list of products. The program should take a list of product prices (eg. 50, 150, 600, 1200) and apply the respective discount to each product, then return the total discounted cost."
