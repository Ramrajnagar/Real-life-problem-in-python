    "You are taking an exam with four types of questions: 10 questions are 4 marks each, 10 questions are 3 marks each, 10 questions are 2 marks each, and 5 questions are 1 mark each. For each correct answer, you receive full marks, while each incorrect answer results in a deduction of 1 mark. You answered 5 questions from the 4-mark section, 4 questions from the 3-mark section, 7 questions from the 2-mark section, and 3 questions from the 1-mark section. Out of these, 8 answers were incorrect. Calculate the total marks you achieved, your percentage score, and determine if you passed the exam, given that the passing mark is 80. Write a function that takes these numbers as input and does all the calculations to return the output.\n"
